Week 4 Project - Basic Business Website - https://scottietex.github.io/Mucky%20Pup%20Grooming%20Salon/index.html

Website for a small fictional business - dog grooming salon - Mucky Pup.

Basic business website with linked pages and online booking feature through appointments page.  Seperate pages for contact details, services offered, FAQs and also an About Us section with details about the business.

Technologies used - html, css, bootstrap.

Would like to experiment with different fonts and would have liked to add some kind of hover effect to the "services" images, to show the sizes, rather than use figcaption.  Feel like the site itself could be more interactive with bookings.  Wanted to add a functioning calendar to the Appointments page but was not sure how.

USER STORIES:

USER 1: As a pet owner, I want to easily see what is offered so I can select the right service for my pet

USER 2: As a pet owner, I want to easily find information on the business such as location and opening hours, so I know if I can visit.

USER 3: As a pet owner, I want to make an appointment online, so I can quickly align it with my schedule.
